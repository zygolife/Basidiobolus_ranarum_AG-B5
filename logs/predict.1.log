[Sep 06 12:13 PM]: 21,059 total gene models from EVM
[Sep 06 12:13 PM]: Generating protein fasta files from 21,059 EVM models
[Sep 06 12:13 PM]: now filtering out bad gene models (< 50 aa in length, transposable elements, etc).
[Sep 06 12:14 PM]: Found 3,028 gene models to remove: 23 too short; 0 span gaps; 3,005 transposable elements
[Sep 06 12:14 PM]: 18,031 gene models remaining
[Sep 06 12:14 PM]: Predicting tRNAs
[Sep 06 12:14 PM]: 596 tRNAscan models are valid (non-overlapping)
[Sep 06 12:14 PM]: Generating GenBank tbl annotation file
[Sep 06 12:16 PM]: Collecting final annotation files for 18,627 total gene models
[Sep 06 12:16 PM]: Converting to final Genbank format
[Sep 06 12:19 PM]: Funannotate predict is finished, output files are in the /bigdata/stajichlab/shared/projects/ZyGoLife/Basidiobolus/Basidiobolus_ranarum/annotate/Basidiobolus_ranarum_AG-B5.v1/predict_results folder
[Sep 06 12:19 PM]: Your next step to capture UTRs and update annotation using PASA:

  funannotate update -i /bigdata/stajichlab/shared/projects/ZyGoLife/Basidiobolus/Basidiobolus_ranarum/annotate/Basidiobolus_ranarum_AG-B5.v1 --cpus 24

[Sep 06 12:19 PM]: Add species parameters to database:

  funannotate species -s basidiobolus_ranarum_ag-b5 -a /bigdata/stajichlab/shared/projects/ZyGoLife/Basidiobolus/Basidiobolus_ranarum/annotate/Basidiobolus_ranarum_AG-B5.v1/predict_results/basidiobolus_ranarum_ag-b5.parameters.json
